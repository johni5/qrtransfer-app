                <p>Last updated: 29.09.2024</p>

                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>QRTransfer</strong> application (hereinafter referred to as the
                    “App”) allows users
                    to exchange small-sized files through QR code generation and scanning. We
                    respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
                    This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, how we use it, and how we
                    ensure its security.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>QRTransfer</strong> app does not collect, store, or process any
                    personal user data.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Personal Data</b>: The app does not request, store, or transmit any
                        personally
                        identifiable information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Technical Data</b>: The
                        app does not track or collect information about your device, IP addresses,
                        network usage, or other technical data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>File Usage</h2>

                <p>
                    The app generates QR codes for file transfer and allows users to scan QR codes
                    to receive files. Transferred files are saved locally on your device in the
                    Downloads folder. Only you and the applications authorized by your device can
                    access these files. The <b>QRTransfer</b> app does not have access to these
                    files after
                    the transfer and does not store any copies of the transferred data.
                </p>

                <h2>File Sharing</h2>

                <p>
                    All files transferred through the app are processed locally on the user's
                    device. File sharing is performed without the use of third-party servers or
                    network connections. QR codes contain encoded file information, which can only
                    be decoded by the device scanning the QR code.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>

                <p>
                    We take reasonable measures to ensure the security of data transmitted through
                    the app:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The app does not transmit files over the internet or through cloud services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All file transfer operations occur locally on the user’s device.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security when using the device,
                    especially if it is exposed to virus attacks or hacking. Please use the app with
                    caution when transferring sensitive information.
                </p>

                <h2>

                </h2>

                <p>

                </p>

                <h2>User Rights</h2>
                <p>

                    time through your file manager.
                </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Limitation of Liability:</b> Under no circumstances shall the app
